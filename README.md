# ToDoPlus

## Overview

The ToDoPlus application is a simple To-Do list. However, ToDoPlus provides the user with the feature to backup all their data on Google Drive, allowing the user to retrieve it from other devices. The user is not required to log in to the Google account. The user can just continue to use the app in offline mode. ToDoPlus also supports local notifications with its own custom chime.
